Capstone project for Data Analytics Cohort 5:
The innitial assessment will look at flu data at the national and state level, but may be expanded to include US territories including American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if health mandates, social changes, and business practice changes affected the spread of influenza within the United States

Due to a less robust reporting system in previous years, we will be looking at data pulled from 2010 and on.

Data Sources:
World Health Organization (WHO) Centers for Disease Control (CDC) State Population Data

Tools:
Python3 Jypyter Notebook MS Excel MS Power Point

Issues:
There is one main issue that persists with this project, and that is a lack of data.

While state level and national level datasets are readily accessible in regards to influenza statistics, datasets that drill down to the county or city level are not. While these datasets do exist, as can be seen in the weekly influenza reports found in each state's health department home page, those are pdf reports and do not contain the raw data, and as of 1/6/22 the department of health for Tennessee, New York, Hawaii, Wyoming, and Florida have not responded to emails requesting those datasets.

There are two states in particular that would benefit from acquisition of that data: Wyoming and Florida.

Wyoming is the only state that did not have a significant drop in influenza cases between 2019 and 2020, dropping from 82 total cases in 2019 to 80 cases in 2020.

Florida is notable in that, while the state's health department does have data on yearly, and even weekly, influenza outbreaks, the data provided to the CDC by public and clinical labs is empty save for reporting during 2021.

The second issue with datasets, or lack thereof, is that there are currently not datasets examining compliance with any of the health mandates or rules created by private businesses.

The Future of this project:
With the eventual acquisition of state datasets, we can delve deeper into the data and find out how local health madates and business changes (i.e. restaurants and grocery stores requiring masks) affected the spread of influenza compared to areas that did not develope such responses to the Covid-19 Pandemic.
