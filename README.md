## Capstone project for Data Analytics Cohort 5: 

Tracking flu, mask mandates, and social distancing/business restrictions across the US during the covid pandemic (2020), 
and comparing those findings to previous years.

The innitial assessment will look at flu data at the national, state, county, and city(where applicable) level, but may be 
expanded to include US territories including American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and 
the US Virgin Islands.

The purpose of this analysis is to determine is these mandates and policies, or lack there of, affected influenza in the 
same way they were designed to affect covid-19.




## Stretch goals include: 

Tracking individual strains to explain why one of the 4 primary strains, B/Yamagata, went extinct during 2020. This 
goal will require global tracking to prove that answer, but national tracking may give clues to it's decline.

Tracking outbreaks at popular tourist destinations where covid restrictions were more lax.

Tracking political(touchy subject, may avoid), socio-economic, average education, and other factors by state, county, city, 
and zipcodes to find if there are any meaningful correlations between said factors and what policies are put in place as 
well as how each factor might correlate to variations in flu activity




## Analysis Plan

National level:
    Pull datasets for flu infection by state, do not drill down further
    Pull datasets for mask, social distancing, etc. mandates by state, may drill down further if needed

State level:
    Pull datasets for flu infection by state, county, city, etc. go with three to five states(Tennessee, New York, Texas, 
    Alaska, Hawaii)
    Pull datasets for mask, social distancing, etc. mandates by state, county, city, etc.
